#summary requirement for yet another command-line parser for Java

= Requirement =
There are several, hundreds and possibly more, command line parser programs for Java.

A quick search on Google has several entries; the top results include the following products.

  * [http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~lloyd/java/argparser.html argparser] It is the first to appear in the list of results from Google to the search: 'cli parser java'
  * [http://jargs.sourceforge.net JArgs] Last updated 2005.April.12
  * [http://journals.ecs.soton.ac.uk/java/tutorial/java/cmdLineArgs/parsing.html parseCmdLine] Java tutorial available at a UK Java site.
  * [http://www.martiansoftware.com/jsap/ JSAP] Java Simple Argument Parser.
  * [http://jopt-simple.sourceforge.net/ JOpt Simple] JOpt Simple is a Java library for parsing command line options, such as those you might pass to an invocation of javac. 
  * [http://code.google.com/p/cli-parser/ cli-parser] This entry shows as the only result when searching for 'cli java' in Google Code.
  * [http://commons.apache.org/cli/ Apache Commons] The Apache Commons CLI library provides an API for processing command line interfaces. 
  * [http://javathink.blogspot.com/2008/04/why-does-parsing-arguments-in-java-suck.html a blog entry re subject] This blog entry describes well the state of command-line software for java and list 13-products found when started a search much as I did.

Reviwing these and other entries, it was time to give a try to yet another entry. The requirements listed are as follows:
  # Definition. The tool should allow a simple definition of each parameter entry and includes the following attributes:
    * Name. A primary name and alias which uniquely identifies the entry.
    * Value. Default value. 
    * Validation expression. Regular-expressions, regex, are identified as an appropriate solution to allow definition of various types, such as integer, date, time, etc., but without getting into Java types, use instead Strings + Regular Expressions.
    * Help message. Define a message string to describe the purpose and format of a parameter.
    * Required indicator. Ability to indicate that a parameter is required; default is optional.
  # Parsing. A validate process followed by a parse process producing a Map containg the resultant merged values for use by the caller.
